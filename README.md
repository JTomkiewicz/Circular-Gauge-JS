# Description

The application retrieves data from the `deviation sensor`, which exports its data by pretending to be a keyboard - enters the numbers (one by one) and clicks enter.
The result obtained is displayed on the `graphic gauge`, so you can see precisely how the deviation changes from the initial value set.

# How to use

Just open the `index.html` page from the pages folder in `any browser` to run the application. There is no need to start the server -  it is a static page.
